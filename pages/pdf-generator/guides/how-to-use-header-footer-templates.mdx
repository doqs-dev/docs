# How to use header and footer templates?
And how to make your generate PDF documents more beautiful ðŸŽ¨

<br/>
## Limitations and caveats
Due to our rendering engine being based on chromium we have the following limitations:
1. External resource cannot be loaded, this includes stylesheets, images, javascript or external fonts. For images you can use base64 encoded data URIs, and for CSS you can use inline styles.
2. No javascript execution possible.
3. Chromium wraps the footer and header html, so make sure not to use a root html or body tag, as this leads to invalid HTML and ultimately to wrongly rendered items.

<Callout>
  Chromium is known for having scaling issues in the header or footer, leading to smaller displayed items especially
  noticeable on fonts. <br/>
  <b>But don't worry, we make sure your document content are displayed correctly!</b>

## Special CSS classes
The following CSS classes are supported in header and footer elements:
* An element with the class `.pageNumber` will output the current page number, starting with 1.
* An element with the class `.totalPages` will output the total number of pages in the document.

## Experimental: Use paged.js
[paged.js](https://pagedjs.org/) takes care of paginating the HTML for your PDF document.
It additionally allows you to use Javascript and external resources in the header and footers, as those are defined in the main HTML template too.
**Be aware**: paged.js significantly increases the rendering time due to the computation of the layout.
