In many cases, documents are commonly stored in block storages such as AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Dropbox. Our platform
simplifies the process of uploading documents to your chosen provider by eliminating the need for sharing or configuring intricate details.

To get started, all you need to do is generate a temporary presigned upload URL with your selected provider
and share it with us. From there, we will handle the task of uploading the file directly to your chosen provider after rendering it.
