# Introduction

[doqs.dev](https://doqs.dev) is a service that makes it easy to fill out PDF documents.

1. Create the PDF template by uploading the file
2. Configure the form fields in our easy template editor or via API
3. Fill the template with your data provided through an API call

<br/>
The API requires a key to authenticate the requests, is provided in our dashboard. [You can get one for free by signing up.](https://app.doqs.dev/signup)
If you already are signed up we go into more detail on how to handle the API key in the [authentication section.](/api-reference/authentication)
