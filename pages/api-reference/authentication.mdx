# Authentication

Authenticate your api calls by providing your api key in the header. You can retrieve and manage your api keys in the [dashboard](https://app.doqs.dev/organization).

## Headers

| Header    | Value                           |
|:----------|:--------------------------------|
| x-api-key | your api key from the dashboard |


## Examples
This is an example of how to authenticate your api calls in python with the requests library.
```python
requests.post("...", headers={"x-api-key": "your-secret-value"})
```
