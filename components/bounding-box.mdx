            The units of the bounding box are points. They are mainly driven by the page size and resolution of the
            underlying PDF document.
            For example an A4 page with width of 210mm and height of 297mm and a default resolution of 72 DPI results in
            a page width of 595.27 and height of 841.88 pts.
            The root coordinate (0, 0) is the lower left corner of the page.
