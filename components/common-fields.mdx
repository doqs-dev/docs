                <p>
                    The units of the bounding box are points. They are mainly driven by the page size and resolution of
                    the
                    underlying PDF document.
                    For example an A4 page with width of 210 mm and height of 297 mm and a default resolution of 72 DPI
                    results in
                    a page width of 595.27 and height of 841.88 pts.
                    The root coordinate (0, 0) is the lower left corner of the page.
